## Explanation for Problem 4: Dutch National Flag Problem

The Dutch National Flag Problem involves sorting an array consisting solely of 0s, 1s, and 2s. The solution is achieved through a single traversal of the array, making use of a three-pointer technique that categorizes the array into sections for each number.

### Solution Approach

The solution employs three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`, to partition the array into three sections. 

- **Low Pointer**: This points to the next position where a 0 should be placed. It starts at the beginning of the array.
- **Mid Pointer**: This serves as the current element being examined. It iterates through the array from start to end.
- **High Pointer**: This points to the next position where a 2 should be placed, starting from the end of the array.

The algorithm proceeds by examining the element at the `mid` pointer:
- If the element is 0, it is swapped with the element at the `low` pointer, and both `low` and `mid` pointers are incremented. This action moves all 0s to the beginning of the array.
- If the element is 1, the `mid` pointer is simply incremented. 1s naturally accumulate between the 0s and 2s without needing to be moved.
- If the element is 2, it is swapped with the element at the `high` pointer, and the `high` pointer is decremented, while the `mid` pointer stays unchanged. This is because the element swapped to the `mid` position has not been examined yet. This step moves all 2s to the end of the array.

### Efficiency Analysis

#### Time Complexity: O(n)
The algorithm makes a single pass through the array with the `mid` pointer, examining each element once. Regardless of the array's size, each element requires constant time to process, resulting in linear time complexity.

#### Space Complexity: O(1)
The space complexity is constant because the sorting is done in-place, utilizing only a fixed amount of additional space for the three pointers and temporary variables used for swapping.

### Conclusion

This solution to the Dutch National Flag Problem showcases the effectiveness of using pointer manipulation to categorize and sort elements in a single pass. It adheres to the O(n) time complexity requirement by efficiently classifying the array into sections of 0s, 1s, and 2s, without the need for additional storage or multiple traversals. The three-pointer technique employed here exemplifies a practical approach to solving array partitioning problems with specific constraints.
