# Explanation for Problem 1: Square Root of an Integer

## Decision Rationale

For finding the square root of an integer without utilizing any Python library, I chose the binary search algorithm due to its efficiency in handling sorted or ordered data. This choice was driven by the nature of the problem, where the square root of an integer falls within an ordered set of potential values (from 0 to the integer itself). Binary search significantly reduces the search space by comparing the middle element of the search space to the target value and narrowing the search to the half that may contain the square root, achieving logarithmic time complexity.

The use of binary search over a brute-force approach (checking every number up to the integer) or other search algorithms was primarily due to its time efficiency. Binary search operates in O(log n) time, making it vastly superior to a linear search for large numbers. Additionally, since the square root function deals with integers and requires finding the floor value of the square root, binary search's iterative halving aligns well with narrowing down to the precise integer square root or its floor value.

## Efficiency Analysis

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is O(log n), where n is the value of the number whose square root we are trying to find. This logarithmic complexity arises because, with each comparison, the algorithm reduces the potential search space by half, quickly converging on the square root or its floor value.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is O(1), indicating constant space usage. This efficiency is due to the algorithm only requiring a few variables to keep track of the search boundaries (`start`, `end`, and `mid`) and the temporary calculation (`square`), regardless of the size of the input number. No additional data structures or recursive stack space are used, making the space usage minimal and independent of the input size.

In conclusion, the choice of binary search for finding the square root of an integer is justified by its optimal time efficiency for sorted data and minimal space requirements. This approach ensures that the solution is both fast and resource-efficient, particularly important for large input values.
