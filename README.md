# Basic Algorithms Problems

## Overview

This project is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree program. It covers the implementation and analysis of various algorithmic problems using Python 3. The focus is on applying data structures and algorithmic techniques to solve practical problems efficiently.

## Problems Overview

1. **Square Root of an Integer**: Finding the square root of an integer without using any Python library, focusing on the floor value of the square root.
2. **Search in a Rotated Sorted Array**: Searching for a target value in a rotated sorted array without using Python's built-in search functions.
3. **Rearrange Array Digits**: Rearranging array elements to form two numbers such that their sum is maximum.
4. **Dutch National Flag Problem**: Sorting an array consisting only of 0s, 1s, and 2s in a single traversal.
5. **Autocomplete with Tries**: Implementing an autocomplete system using the Trie data structure.
6. **Unsorted Integer Array**: Finding the minimum and maximum in an unsorted integer array in linear time.
7. **HTTP Router using a Trie**: Implementing an HTTP Router for web server route matching using the Trie data structure.

## Project Structure

Each problem in the project is accompanied by two files:
- A Python script named `problem_[x].py`, where `[x]` is the problem number. This script contains the Python 3 solution.
- An explanation file named `explanation_[x].md`, detailing the solution's design choices, time and space efficiency, and overall approach.

These files provide a comprehensive view of the problem-solving process, from conceptualization to implementation, demonstrating the application of data structures and algorithms in addressing diverse challenges.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate proficiency in using data structures and algorithms to craft efficient, effective solutions to complex problems. It reflects an understanding of fundamental computer science concepts and their application in software development, underscoring the practical importance of these skills in a professional context.
