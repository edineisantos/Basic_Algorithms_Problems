## Explanation for Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits

This problem focuses on maximizing the sum of two numbers formed by rearranging the digits of a given array. The key to solving this challenge lies in the strategic distribution of digits to ensure the sum of the constructed numbers is as large as possible, adhering to a time complexity of O(nlog(n)).

### Design Decisions:

#### Descending Quick Sort:
The first crucial step involves sorting the array digits in descending order. This arrangement ensures that the largest digits are considered first when forming the two numbers, directly contributing to maximizing their sum. A custom implementation of the quick sort algorithm, `quick_sort_descending`, was chosen for this task due to its efficiency in sorting and its compliance with the problem's complexity requirement. Quick sort is ideal for this scenario as it offers an average and worst-case time complexity of O(nlog(n)), fitting within the problem's constraints.

#### Alternating Digit Distribution:
Once sorted, the digits are distributed between two numbers in an alternating fashion, starting with the highest digit. This method ensures that the numbers formed have their largest possible digits at the highest place values, inherently maximizing their sum. Alternating the digits also helps maintain the condition that the number of digits in both numbers cannot differ by more than one, a crucial requirement of the problem.

### Efficiency Analysis:

#### Time Complexity:
The predominant factor affecting time complexity is the descending quick sort algorithm, which operates with a time complexity of O(nlog(n)). The subsequent process of alternating digit distribution runs in linear time, O(n), as it involves a single pass through the sorted array. Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution remains O(nlog(n)).

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is primarily O(log(n)) due to the space required for the recursion stack used in the quick sort algorithm. The additional space used for constructing the two numbers is negligible and does not significantly impact the overall space complexity.

### Conclusion:

The solution to rearranging array digits to form two numbers with a maximum sum is elegantly achieved through a combination of descending quick sort and an alternating digit distribution strategy. This approach not only ensures that the sum of the numbers is maximized but also adheres to the specified time and space complexity requirements. The problem underscores the importance of choosing appropriate sorting algorithms and effectively utilizing array manipulation techniques to solve complex problems efficiently.
