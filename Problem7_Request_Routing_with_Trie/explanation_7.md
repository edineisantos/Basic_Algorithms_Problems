## Explanation for Problem 7: Request Routing in a Web Server with a Trie

This problem introduces the implementation of an HTTP Router using a Trie data structure, a scenario that emulates the routing mechanism of a web server. Unlike standard Tries which store individual characters at each node, this specialized Trie stores segments of HTTP paths, divided by slashes ("/"), at its nodes. This design choice significantly reduces the complexity and size of the Trie, making it well-suited for efficiently matching URL paths to their corresponding handlers.

### Design Considerations

#### RouteTrie and RouteTrieNode Classes
The `RouteTrie` is a variant of the Trie structure tailored for HTTP path segmentation and routing:
- Each `RouteTrieNode` represents a segment of the path and may contain a handler if it corresponds to a complete path.
- The `RouteTrie` facilitates adding new routes with their handlers and finding handlers based on request paths.

#### Router Class
The `Router` class wraps the `RouteTrie` and abstracts route handling and lookup:
- Routes are added to the `Router` by splitting the path into segments and inserting them into the `RouteTrie`, associating the final segment with the given handler.
- Looking up a path involves splitting it into segments, traversing the `RouteTrie` according to these segments, and returning the matched handler.

### Efficiency Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- **Insertion**: O(n), where n is the number of segments in the path. Each segment insertion is a constant-time operation due to the use of a dictionary to store children in each `RouteTrieNode`.
- **Lookup**: O(m), where m is the number of segments in the lookup path. The operation involves traversing the Trie from the root node to the node representing the final segment of the path, with each step being a constant-time lookup in the node's children dictionary.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is largely dependent on the number of unique paths and their depth in the `RouteTrie`. Specifically, it is O(p*s), where p is the number of unique path segments across all routes and s is the average size of the handlers. Each node in the Trie may store a handler, contributing to the space complexity.

### Handling Special Cases
- **Not Found Handler**: Implementing a default not found handler enhances the router's robustness by providing a fallback for unmatched paths.
- **Trailing Slashes**: Normalizing paths to uniformly handle trailing slashes prevents duplication and ensures consistent routing.

### Conclusion

Implementing an HTTP Router with a Trie data structure provides an efficient and effective solution for web server routing. This approach leverages the Trie's hierarchical nature to segment URL paths, allowing for fast insertion and lookup operations that scale linearly with the path's length. By carefully designing the `RouteTrie`, `RouteTrieNode`, and `Router` classes, and considering edge cases like not found handlers and trailing slashes, we can build a robust routing system suited for dynamic web applications.
