## Explanation for Problem 5: Building a Trie in Python

This problem involves constructing a Trie, or Prefix Tree, which is a specialized tree used to store dynamic sets of strings. Unlike binary search trees, where each node represents a single key, a Trie node represents a single character of a string, and the path from the root to a particular node represents a prefix of some string(s) in the set. Tries are particularly useful for implementing features like autocomplete or spell checking, where quick prefix lookups are essential.

### Design Considerations

#### TrieNode Class
The `TrieNode` serves as the fundamental building block of the Trie. Each node contains:
- A dictionary named `children` to store child nodes, facilitating O(1) lookup times for the next character in a string.
- A boolean flag `is_end_of_word` to indicate whether the node corresponds to the end of a word in the Trie. This helps quickly determine if a prefix is also a complete word.

The `insert` method allows adding new children to a node, expanding the Trie as new words are added.

#### Trie Class
The `Trie` itself encapsulates the Trie structure and offers a user-friendly interface for common operations:
- The constructor initializes the Trie with a root node, representing an empty string or the start of any word.
- The `insert` method adds new words to the Trie, leveraging the `insert` method of `TrieNode` to place each character in the correct location.
- The `find` method locates the node corresponding to the end of a given prefix, enabling operations like suffix listing or word existence checking.

#### Suffixes Listing
To enable autocomplete features, we extend the `TrieNode` class with a `suffixes` method. This recursive function traverses the subtree rooted at the node, collecting all suffixes (the parts of words that follow the current prefix). The recursion base case is reached when `is_end_of_word` is true, indicating a complete word has been formed. As the recursion unwinds, it accumulates the characters on the path to form each suffix.

### Efficiency Analysis

#### Time Complexity
- Inserting a word of length `k` into the Trie requires O(k) time, as each character's insertion into the `children` dictionary takes constant time.
- Finding a node corresponding to a prefix of length `p` takes O(p) time, proportional to the length of the prefix.
- Listing all suffixes for a prefix involves traversing the subtree rooted at the prefix's end node. The time complexity depends on the number of nodes in the subtree and the lengths of the words they form but remains efficient due to the localized nature of the traversal.

#### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of the Trie is O(n * k), where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of the words. This accounts for the storage of each character of each word in separate nodes.

### Conclusion

The Trie data structure provides an efficient means of storing and querying strings for applications requiring fast prefix lookups, such as autocomplete systems. By carefully implementing the `Trie` and `TrieNode` classes and enabling suffix listing, we can support complex text processing features with both high efficiency and effectiveness.
